 limitation is that the data does not include detailed information on the donation statistics. We only have access to the average donation. We do not have access to the data of the individual person that donated. It would be interesting to find on factors such as how much each person contributed, gender, or age and area.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
